Visualization 1. Simple visualization Visualize relationship between Women Height ( women$height ) and Women Weight ( women$weight ) #svg(\"women_plot.svg\", width = 6, height = 6) #set up figure's size plot(women$height, women$weight, main = \"Height vs Weight for American Women\", xlab = \"Height (inches)\", # y-axis label ylab = \"Weight (pounds)\", # y-axis label pch = 16, # point size col = \"blue\") # color abline(lm(weight ~ height, data = women), col = \"red\", lwd = 2) # red regression line #dev.off() #export Note : In R, $ means of dataframe . women$height means taking height variable (column) from dataframe women . Here what you'll get 2. Visualization with ggplot2 library Visualize relationship between Women Height ( women$height ) and Women Weight ( women$weight ) library(ggplot2) # Create the plot p <- ggplot(women, aes(x = height, y = weight)) + geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 1) + # blue points (pch = 16 equivalent) geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1) + # red regression line labs(title = \"Height vs Weight for American Women\", # main title x = \"Height (inches)\", # x-axis label y = \"Weight (pounds)\") + # y-axis label theme_minimal() #ggsave(\"women_plot.svg\", plot = p, width = 4.5, height = 4.5, units = \"in\", device = \"svg\") # Export as SVG Here what you'll get Hypothesis testing 1. Test of signficance Use cor.test() function to test the signicance of hypothesis. cor.test(women$height, women$weight) Note : Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between variables.
